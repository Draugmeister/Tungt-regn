# What Do You Need to Know?

## Saves

A Save is a roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation. 
Roll 2d20 and compare it to the appropriate Ability Score.

- __Both under__ is a __full success__ — things go well.
- __One over, one under__, is a __partial success__ — you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences or complications.
- __Both over__, is __bad__. 

## Die of Fate

If something is uncertain in the fiction, you may roll a D6 to get answers.

__4-6__ It's something nice, helpfull or advantageus.
__2-3__ It's something potentially bad.
__1__   It's not good at all.

## Fighting

If you get in a fight, the fiction decides who attacks when. If someone punches you, you can say that you run away or that you spit in their face.

When it is unclear which combat side should act first, the character at the head of the group must pass a dex save to secure the first action.
