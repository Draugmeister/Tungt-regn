# Your Character

## Who Are You?

Roll 3d6 for each __Ability Score__. 10 is average. 

__Strength__ – Fighting, fortitude, and toughness.  
__Dexterity__ – Stealth, athletics, and reflexes.  
__Willpower__ – Confidence, discipline, and charisma.  

Characters start with d6 __Hit Points__, a measure of their ability to avoid life-threatening Damage.

## Companions

For small player groups, each player may create one or more companions. Roll their Ability Scores in order and give them 1 hp and a sword.

## What Do You Have?

Match your highest __Ability Score__ against your __Hit Points__ to find your starting package. Weapons have their damage roll listed. If two characters would have the same equipment, the second character takes their starting package from the column to the left, or right if this is not possible.
