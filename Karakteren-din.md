# Your Character

## Who Are You?

Roll 3d6 for each __Ability Score__. 10 is average. 

__Strength__ – Fighting, fortitude, and toughness.  
__Dexterity__ – Stealth, athletics, and reflexes.  
__Willpower__ – Confidence, discipline, and charisma.  

Characters start with d6 __Hit Points__, a measure of their ability to avoid life-threatening Damage.

## What Do You Have?

Match your highest Ability Score against your Hit Points to find your starting package. Weapons have their damage roll listed. If two characters would have the same equipment, the second character takes their starting package from the column to the left, or right if this is not possible.
